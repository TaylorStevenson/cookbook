title: "Pizza Dough"
image: pizza-dough.jpg
serves: 3 or 4 pizzas

ingredients:
- 340g warm water
- 500g flour
- 2 tsp. instant yeast
- 1 tsp. sugar
- 2 tsp. salt
- 1 tbls olive oil (opt)

directions:
- mix warm water with sugar and yeast and allow to bloom (optional)
- mix in flour and salt until a ragged dough forms. Add oil if desired.
- leave covered in bowl for 30 minutes. This will make the dough easier to kneed.
- kneed the dough for 8-15 minutes or until it can stretch very thin without tearing.
- form dough into a ball and place in a bowl. 
- put plastic wrap over the top of the dough ball, and then more over the bowl.
- place in the fridge for 1-4 days.
- remove from fridge, portion, form into smaller balls and either make pizza or freeze in smaller containers.

Increase the water content for a chewier dough with bigger bubbles, but keep in mind it will be harder to work with. If kneeding is too tough, you can repeatedly pick up the dough and slap it down onto the bench, folding it over itself each time.

More time in the fridge leads to a more flavourful dough. Replace some of the yeast with sourdough starter for sourdough pizzas.
