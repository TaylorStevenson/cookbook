ingredients:
- room temperature pizza dough
- canned peeled whole tomatoes
- tomato paste
- Salt and pepper
- dried oregano
- olive oil
- low-moisture mozzarella cheese
- parmesan cheese (optional)
- other toppings (optional)

directions:
- pre-heat a large cast iron pan in the oven on the top shelf.
- mash the peeled whole tomatoes in a bowl, add tomato paste, salt and oregano.
- flour your bench-top, place down the dough and cover with more flour.
- press the centre of the dough outwards with your finger-tips, leaving a ~2cm ring around the outside (this will become the crust).
- turn the dough around on your knuckles (both hands).
- hold the dough with both hands and let it hang so that the center stretches out but the crust does not. Turn the dough until the centre is as thin as possible.
- brush the crust with olive oil.
- take your cast iron out of the oven, place the dough in the pan, add the sauce, mozzarella cheese and any other topings.
- place back in the oven and cook for 5-15 mins, depending on the temperature of your oven.
- store any remaining pizza sauce in a jar topped with olive oil.
