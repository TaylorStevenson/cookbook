tags: beef
serves: NA

ingredients:
- 1kg beef mince (or 500g each of beef and pork mince)
- 2 onions
- 5 carrots
- 2 sticks of celery (opt.)
- lots of garlic
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1/3 cup of milk
- 1/2 cup dry red or white wine
- 1 small can of tomato paste (opt.)
- 400g can of while peeled tomatoes

directions:
- finely dice or grate onions, carrots and celery. Alternatively use a food processor.
- heat olive oil in a large pot and cook the diced vegetables to sweeten them.
- add garlic (adding at this stage will stop it burning and becoming bitter).
- remove the veggies or move them from the centre of the pot, and add the beef and/or pork mince.
- break up the mince with a wooden spoon and cook until a fond forms in the pot. Reincorporate the veggies.
- Add the can of tomatos (and optionally the tomato paste), breaking them up with a wooden spoon.
- add wine and cook until the alcohol is evaporated.
- add stock and then milk (the milk will help to tenderise the meat).
- cook on medium heat, reducing for for several hours (or as long as you can wait).

The longer you leave it cooking the better it gets. Mix through some long, flat pasta or use it for a lasagna.
